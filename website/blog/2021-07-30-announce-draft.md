Steve Jobs say this during the first iPhone presentation on 2007. And it's
exactly the last time a **revolutionary user interface** changes the way
software interact with users.

So will chatbot be the next one? Will it changes the way we build software following the _desktop apps_,
_web apps_ and _mobile apps_? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have a clear
answer till today.


### Learning form 

To find out what does chatbot still lack of,
we can learn from the past. Here are some of the most extraordinary apps built
on different user interfaces:


<div></div>


Among these apps with so many different features, we can find out these
three common points:


- **Programmable UI**:
  All these apps are built with programming language codes. It require
  programmable UIs to serve the best experiences.
- **Cross-Platform**:
  The most successful apps are always cross-platform. It's the key to reach more
  users and get success in business.
- **Ship Utilities**:
  A great app ships real features to users, instead of just being fancy.


Below we'll show you how Machinat framework can help to make best chatbot apps on these three aspects.

### Programmable UI

Before diving deeper, let's take a peek of the main stream way to build a chatbot:

<div></div>


The most popular tools go for no-code solutions, which is easier for non-developer users to get started. But the approach can lead some serious problems:

1. Very limited message formats.
2. Inflexible message content.
2. Very poor and rigid conversation logic.
3. Not modularizable nor scalable.

That's why we believe the best app can only be built with programming framework. And here are our answer to build chat UI: **Expression View** and the **Dialog Script**.


### Expression View

Chat is a view! 


### Dialog Script

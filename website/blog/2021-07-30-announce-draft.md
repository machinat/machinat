Steve Jobs say this during the first iPhone presentation on 2007. And it's
exactly the last time a **revolutionary user interface** changes the way
software interact with users.

Since about 2016, what everyone keeps asking is that **will chatbot be the next
one?** Will it changes the way we build software following the _desktop apps_,
_web apps_ and _mobile apps_? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have a clear
answer till today.


### Learning form 

To find out what do chatbots still need to become the next-gen application format,
we can learn from the past. Here are some of the most extraordinary apps built
on different user interfaces:


<div></div>


Among these apps with so many different features, we can find out these
three common points:


- **Programmable UI**:
  All these apps are built with programming language codes. It require
  programmable UIs to serve the best experiences.
- **Cross-Platform**:
  The most successful apps are always cross-platform. It's the key to reach more
  users and get success in business.
- **Ship Utilities**:
  A great app ships real features to users, instead of just being fancy.


Below we'll show you the amazing solutions that Machinat framework provide.
Which help you make best chatbot apps on these three aspects.



### Programmable UI

Before introducing the way building UIs in Machinat, let's take a peek about the
main stream way:

As you can see, the most popular frameworks/tools go for no-code solutions.
Though it's easier for non-developer users to get started with, there could be
some serious problems:

- It's hard to make dynamic messages content. You can only make very limited
  variations.
- The dialog flows are not flexible enough, and you can't modularize them as 
  well. It's almost impossible to build very complex dialog and logic.

And here are our answer to them: **Messages View** and the **Dialog Script**.


### Messages View

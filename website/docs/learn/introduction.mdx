Welcome! In this tutorial, you'll make your first conversational app with Machinat.

Machinat framework is designed to build _cross-platform_, _production-ready_ and _feature-rich_ apps on chat platforms.
We have some revolutionary tools to make UI/UX in chat.
This course will bring you through them by making a real-world app.

## What will we build?

We'll make a **Todo** app with basic CRUD operations. Users can manage their todos in the chatroom, through a conversation or a webview. The app will finally look like this:

<video width={420} autoplay="autoplay" loop inline muted>
  <source src={require("./assets/tutorial-example.webm").default} type="video/webm" />
</video>

## Platforms

You can choose which chat platform to use in the totorial. Please select the
chosen platform if you see these tabs in the lessons:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="messenger"
  values={[
    {label: 'Messenger', value: 'messenger'},
    {label: 'Telegram', value: 'telegram'},
    {label: 'LINE', value: 'line'},
  ]} >
  <TabItem value="messenger" />
  <TabItem value="telegram" />
  <TabItem value="line" />
</Tabs>

A cross-platform app is perfectly supported, but we recommend to adopt one platform for the first time.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with [_TypeScript_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
syntax and _JavaScript ES6_ features.

If it's your first time developing with TypeScript, we recommend using
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor to have full types support.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 10.13 or later
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install) v6.x or later

Welcome! This tutorial will guide you to build a production-ready chabot
with Machinat framework.

Machinat is designed to build **applications** in chat, instead of just chatting.
You'll know how to ship real features to user, using chat UIs, conversation
flows and even an embedded webview.

## What will we build?

We will make a **Todo Bot** app with basic CRUD operations in this tutorial.
User can manage their todos in the chat with bot.

The bot will finally have conversation like this:

<video width={420} autoplay="autoplay" loop inline muted>
  <source src={require("./assets/tutorial-example.webm").default} type="video/webm" />
</video>

## Platforms

You can choose which chat platform to use for the totorial. Please select the
chosen platform if you see these tabs in the lessons:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="messenger"
  values={[
    {label: 'Messenger', value: 'messenger'},
    {label: 'Telegram', value: 'telegram'},
    {label: 'LINE', value: 'line'},
  ]} >
  <TabItem value="messenger" />
  <TabItem value="telegram" />
  <TabItem value="line" />
</Tabs>

Cross-platform app is well supported but we recommend to adopt one platform for the first time.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with [_TypeScript_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
syntax and _JavaScript ES6_ features.

If it's your first time developing with TypeScript, we recommend using
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor to have full types support.

### System Requirement

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 10.13 or later
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install) v6.x or later

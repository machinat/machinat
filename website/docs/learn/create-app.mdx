## Chat Platform

Sociably now supports three chat platforms: `facebook`, `telegram` and `line`.
Pick one platform to use in the lessons and run this command in the terminal:

```bash
npm init @sociably/app@latest -- -p <platform> --webview my-todo-bot
```

The command initiates a new project of a hello-world bot.
Try `cd my-todo-bot` and take a look.

:::tip
To support multiple chat platforms, add more `-p <platform>` flag.

### Platform Setup

Before starting the app, you need to set up the chat platform first. Please
follow the guide of the platform you choose:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import {useTabGroupChoice} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

export const HackTabsChoices = () => {
  const {tabGroupChoices, setTabGroupChoices} = useTabGroupChoice();
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return null;
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const groupId= 'chat-platforms';
    const platform = new URL(window.location.href).searchParams.get('p');
    if (platform !== tabGroupChoices[groupId] &&
        ['facebook', 'telegram', 'line'].includes(platform)) {
      setTabGroupChoices(groupId, platform);
    }
  }, [])
  return null;
}

<HackTabsChoices />

<Tabs
  groupId="chat-platforms"
  defaultValue="facebook"
  values={[
    {label: 'Facebook', value: 'facebook'},
    {label: 'Telegram', value: 'telegram'},
    {label: 'LINE', value: 'line'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="facebook">

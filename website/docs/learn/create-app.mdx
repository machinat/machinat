title: Create a Machinat App
---

Let's create our first Machinat app and run it up! In this lesson, we'll create a
hello-world chatbot and make it available in the chat platform.

>ã€€Time to accomplish: 15 minutes

## Chat Platform

Machinat now support three chat platforms: `messenger`, `telegram` and `line`.
Pick one platform you preferred and run this command with the platform you choose
in the terminal:

```bash
npm init @machinat/app -- -p <platform> -p webview my-todo-bot
```

The scirpt will automatically create codes of a hello-world bot. Now
`cd my-todo-bot` and take a look.

:::tip
You can choose multiple chat platforms by adding more `-p <platform>` flag, and
your app will be corss-platform when finished.

### Platform Setup

Before starting your app, you have to configure the chat platform settings first.
Please follow the guide of the platform you choose:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

  }
  values={[
    {label: 'Messenger', value: 'messenger'},
    {label: 'Telegram', value: 'telegram'},

### Try Your Bot

Your first hello world app is running now! Talk to your bot in the chat platform
and it should work like this:

<img width={400} src={require("./assets/hello-world-bot.png").default} />

#### Reply Text

Let's change the answer a little bit. Open file `src/handlers/handleMessage.tsx`
and edit the content to this:


```tsx title="src/handlers/handleMessage.tsx"
import Machinat from '@machinat/core';
import { ChatEventContext } from '../types';

const handleMessage = async ({
  event,
  reply,
}: ChatEventContext & { event: { category: 'message' } } ) => {
  await reply("Hello! I'm a Todo Bot ðŸ¤–");
};

export default handleMessage;
```

Bot should now answer the string we `reply("...")` with like this:

<img width={400} src={require("./assets/hello-todo-bot.png").default} />

Our first bot is running! Next, we'll teach it how to receive messsges and
make the answer.

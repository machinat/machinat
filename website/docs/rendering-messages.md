title: Rendering Messages
---

In Machinat, **Bot** is an abstraction which in charge of dispatching actions to a [channel](receiving-events.md#the-channel). Depends on the platform it belongs to, it can send message to a chatroom, emit event to a webview or reply on voice assistant.

### `Bot#render(channel, message)`

Bots from all the platforms have to implement the `render` method. For the most of time, `render` is the only entry you need to send various kinds of messages.

- `channel` - the target to send the rendered messages.
- `message` - string or message element to be rendered.

### Sending Text

The most basic way to to send a message is render string directly:

```js
bot.render(channel, 'hello world');
```

Render a string is supported by all platforms of bot.

### Fragment

A fragment is a collection of nodes contained by a `<>...</>` element. This help you to construct UI with a series of content to send:

```js
bot.render(
  channel,
  <>
    Look at the kitty!
    <img src="http://..." />
    Aww I'm melting!
  </>
);
```

When you call `render` with a fragment, all the actions rendered from the message will be sent in order. Bot would dispatch message as an atomic operation. All you need to do is focusing on the UI!

### Textual Node

An element type is *textual* if it renders into strings and other textual elements only. **Textual nodes** include text and textual element or a collection of them.

Neighbor textual nodes will be merged into one text message, for example this renders content in a single text bubble in chatroom:

```js
bot.render(
  channel,
  <>foo <b>bar</b> <i>baz</i></>
);
```

### General Tags

Element with string type (lower cased beginning JSX tag) in Machinat is _general_. It can be rendered by bots of all platforms. Supported element tags and its props are listed below.

##### Textual element types:

- `b` - render children text bold if supported.
  - `children` - textual node.


- `i` - render children text italic if supported.
  - `children` - textual nodes.


- `s` - render the children text with strikethrough if supported.
  - `children` - textual nodes.


- `s` - render the children text with underline if supported.
  - `children` - textual nodes.


- `code` - render children text as monospaced if supported.
  - `children` - textual nodes.


- `pre` - render children text as preformatted if supported.
  - `children` - textual nodes.

- `br` - add a line break.

##### Non-textual element types:

- `p` - wrap a textual content paragraph as text messages bubble.
  - `children` - textual nodes.

- `img` - send an image message.
  - `src` - URL string.


- `audio` - send an audio message.
  - `src` - URL string.


- `video` - send a video message.
  - `src` - URL string.


- `file` - send a file message.
  - `src` - URL string.

### Native Component

The general tags provide a set of unified APIs for making cross-platform UI. But you might want to use more features that only available on particular platform. Use the **native component** from each platform package as the element type like this:

```js
import { MediaTemplate, UrlButton } from '@machinat/messenger/components'

bot.render(
  channel,
  <MediaTemplate
    type="video"
    url="http://..."
    buttons={
      <UrlButton title="Go" url="http://..."/>
    }
  />
);
```

You can only use native component corresponded to the platform of bot. If a bot receive a native component from a different platform when `render`, it would immediately throw at run time.

### Pause

`Machinat.Pause` adds a pause between messages. Add a `<Machinat.Pause time={_ms_to_delay_}/>` element in the expression, and the messages afterwards will be sent with a delay. Like:

```js
bot.render(channel,
  <>
    1
    <Machinat.Pause time={1000} />
    2
    <Machinat.Pause time={1000} />
    3
    <Machinat.Pause time={1000} />
    Red light!
  </>
);
```

An async `delay` function can also be used to measure the time of the pause. It waits until the returned promise is resolved. For example:

```js
async function waitForSomething() {
  await doSomething();
}

bot.render(channel,
  <>
    hello
    <Machinat.Pause delay={() => waitForSomething()} />
    world
  </>
);
```
